          No. This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Thanks, thanks a lot. But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Listen, woh. Hello, uh excuse me. Sorry about your barn. C'mon, c'mon let's go. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on. Children. A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right. Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. No, bastards. Bet your ass it works. Alright, we're the pinheads.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where. What the hell is a gigawatt? Whoa, wait, Doc. My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, bastards. I don't wanna see you in here again. Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. You have this thing hooked up to the car?

          Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world. You're gonna be in the car with her. Yeah, gimme a Tab. No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?
        </p>
        <p>
          No, Biff, you leave her alone. Really. I, I don't know. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance.
